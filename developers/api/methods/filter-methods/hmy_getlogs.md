# hmy\_getLogs

Get harmony logs for smart contracts or transactions

## Parameters

1. `Object` - The filter options:
2. `fromBlock`: `QUANTITY|TAG` - \(optional, default: `"latest"`\) Integer block number, or `"latest"` for the last mined block or `"pending"`, `"earliest"` for not yet mined transactions.
3. `toBlock`: `QUANTITY|TAG` - \(optional, default: `"latest"`\) Integer block number, or `"latest"` for the last mined block or `"pending"`, `"earliest"` for not yet mined transactions.
4. `address`: `DATA|Array`, 20 Bytes - \(optional\) Contract address or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.
5. `topics`: `Array of DATA`, - \(optional\) Array of 32 Bytes `DATA` topics. Topics are order-dependent. Each topic can also be an array of DATA with "or" options.
6. `blockhash`:  `DATA`, 32 Bytes - \(optional\) , `blockHash` is a new filter option which restricts the logs returned to the single block with the 32-byte hash `blockHash`. Using `blockHash` is equivalent to `fromBlock` = `toBlock` = the block number with hash `blockHash`. If `blockHash` is present in the filter criteria, then neither `fromBlock` nor `toBlock` are allowed.

## Returns

For filters created with `hmy_newBlockFilter` the return are block hashes \(`DATA`, 32 Bytes\), e.g. `["0x3454645634534..."]`.

For filters created with `hmy_newPendingTransactionFilter` the return are transaction hashes \(`DATA`, 32 Bytes\), e.g. `["0x6345343454645..."]`.

For filters created with `hmy_newFilter` logs are objects with following params:

* `removed`: `TAG` - `true` when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization. `false` if its a valid log.
* `logIndex`: `QUANTITY` - integer of the log index position in the block. `null` when its pending log.
* `transactionIndex`: `QUANTITY` - integer of the transactions index position log was created from. `null` when its pending log.
* `transactionHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the transactions this log was created from. `null` when its pending log.
* `blockHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the block where this log was in. `null` when its pending. `null` when its pending log.
* `blockNumber`: `QUANTITY` - the block number where this log was in. `null` when its pending. `null` when its pending log.
* `address`: `DATA`, 20 Bytes - address from which this log originated.
* `data`: `DATA` - contains the non-indexed arguments of the log.
* `topics`: `Array of DATA` - Array of 0 to 4 32 Bytes `DATA` of indexed log arguments. \(In _solidity_: The first topic is the _hash_ of the signature of the event \(e.g. `Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)`\), except you declared the event with the `anonymous` specifier.\)
