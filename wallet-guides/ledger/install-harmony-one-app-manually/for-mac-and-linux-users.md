2. A series messages will be displayed including "This app is not genuine" \(as it is a developer edition, not a formal app from Ledger Live\)
3. Click the right button until you see "Open Application",  then click both left and right button to open the Harmony appOnce the application is opened, it will show "Waiting for commands..." in the LCD screen. This means Ledger Nano S is ready for accept commands and sign transactions from the host.

## Removing developer One app from your Ledger device

Since it's possible now to load a One app on the Ledger Nano S via Ledger Live \([Install Harmony One App using Ledger Live](../install-harmony-one-app-using-ledger-live.md)\) you will possibly want to delete the manually installed One app from your Ledger.

Make sure you use the following commands:

```text
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
sudo venv/bin/python -m ledgerblue.deleteApp  --appName One  --targetId 0x31100004
```

Now check your Ledger device and approve the removal of the One app.  
And you are now ready to follow the Ledger Live installation for the One app.
