# Harmony CLI

## Introduction

`hmy` is the official Command Line Interface \(CLI\) provided by Harmony. You can use it as a local wallet and as a way to interact with your Ledger Nano device. The `hmy` CLI is completely open-source. You can track its development and post any issues encountered and your feature suggestions [here](https://github.com/harmony-one/go-sdk).

Be sure to include the output of `$ hmy version` in your bug reports and preferably include the additional output printed when the environment variable HMY\_ALL\_DEBUG is set to true, like so:

`$ HMY_ALL_DEBUG=true hmy transfer ...`
{% endhint %}
