# Download and setup

## Download Harmony CLI tool

### 1. For Linux

Enter the following command into your shell of choice:

```text
$ curl -LO https://harmony.one/hmycli && mv hmycli hmy && chmod +x hmy
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have permission issues, enter the commands with "sudo" at the beginning, i.e. "sudo curl -LO [https://harmony.one/hmycli](https://harmony.one/hmycli) && mv hmycli hmy && chmod +x hmy"
{% endhint %}

### 2. For MacOS

`hmy` depends on some dynamic libraries, hence we recommend using the shell wrapper. Enter there commands into your terminal:

```text
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harmony-one/go-sdk/master/scripts/hmy.sh
$ chmod u+x hmy.sh
$ ./hmy.sh -d
```

Now you can use `hmy.sh` as a wrapper over `hmy` and you should assume that all references to `hmy` in these documents refer to `hmy.sh`. For example, the command `./hmy` becomes `./hmy.sh --` .

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that since `hmy` is not statically linked, you cannot arbitrarily move `hmy.sh` to anywhere on your filesystem like you could with a single binary.
{% endhint %}

### 3. Compiling from source

If you are interested in compiling from source, then the process is more involved.

**Steps:**

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/harmony-one/go-sdk) at the same level as the main Harmony repo:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Have [`mcl`](https://github.com/harmony-one/mcl), [`bls`](https://github.com/harmony-one/bls) all built and prepared. This may require you to see instructions in the [`harmony`](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony) repo's readme.
{% endhint %}

```text
$ cd /Users/edgar/Repos/harmony-work/src/github.com/harmony-one
$ ls
bls   harmony mcl
$ git clone https://github.com/harmony-one/go-sdk.git
```

1. Then setup the build flags:

```text
$ source harmony/scripts/setup_bls_build_flags.sh
```

1. Call `make` in the `go-sdk` repo. This builds a binary named `hmy`:

```text
$ cd go-sdk
$ make
```

Congratulations! You can now use the binary to run the CLI.
