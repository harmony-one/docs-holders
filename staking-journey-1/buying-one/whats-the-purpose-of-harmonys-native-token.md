# Native ONE token

Harmony is a decentralized infrastructure supporting a new, radically transparent economy. Our initial BEP2-ONE and ERC20-ONE tokens distribution helped us take the initial steps of that journey, fueling the first phase of community participation and bootstrapping our token economy.

> The native ONE token of Harmony blockchain will serve as the bridge for building an open platform without sacrificing performance, decentralization, community-based governance, and verifiable security.

## **What’s the purpose of Harmony’s native token?**

Harmony’s scalable, high-throughput protocol is powered by a native token which is used for various forms of payment and participation in the protocol \(staking, transaction fees, voting & governance\).

Harmony uses blockchain to align incentives of different stakeholders, developers and businesses while allowing them to build open marketplaces of fungible and non-fungible tokens and assets. Furthermore, the upcoming application of zero-knowledge proofs will allow Harmony to become a data sharing platform that can overcome the conflicting problem plaguing many information and data markets: that individual market participants’ have mutual distrust to share data but strong desire to acquire data themselves.

The Harmony token will function in the following aspects of the protocol:

1. The token is used for staking, which is necessary to participate in the POS consensus & earn block rewards and transaction fees.
2. The token is used to pay for transaction fees, gas and storage fees.
3. The token is used in voting for on-chain governance of the protocol.
