# Native ONE token

Harmony is a decentralized infrastructure supporting a new, radically transparent economy. Our initial BEP2-ONE and ERC20-ONE tokens distribution helped us take the initial steps of that journey, fueling the first phase of community participation and bootstrapping our token economy.

> The native ONE token of Harmony blockchain will serve as the bridge for building an open platform without sacrificing performance, decentralization, community-based governance, and verifiable security.

## **What’s the purpose of Harmony’s native token?**

Harmony's native ONE token can be used for a number of purposes on the network:

1. The token is used to stake in order to become a validator on the network to earn block rewards and transaction fees. We use Proof of Stake \(POS\) as our sybil resistance mechanism in the protocol.

2. The token is used to pay fees on the network, both transaction fees, gas and storage fees.

3. The token is used in voting for on-chain governance of the protocol. Without the token, the protocol could not function.
