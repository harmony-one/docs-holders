## **What’s the purpose of Harmony’s native token?** <a id="whats-the-purpose-of-harmonys-native-token"></a>

The Harmony token is a protocol token used for a number of purposes on the network.

1. The token is used to stake in order to become a validator on the network to earn block rewards and transaction fees. We use Proof of Stake \(POS\) as our sybil resistance mechanism in the protocol.

2. The token is used to pay fees on the network, both transaction fees, gas and storage fees.

3. The token is used in voting for on-chain governance of the protocol. Without the token, the protocol could not function.
