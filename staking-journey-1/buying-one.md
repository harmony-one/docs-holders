### How to get your native ONE:[Token Swap](https://medium.com/harmony-one/harmony-token-swap-launching-the-native-one-token-8e358e96be32)

In order to stake with Harmony, you need to exchange your interim BEP2 and ERC20 tokens for **native Harmony ONE tokens**. 

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Bitmax" %}
**After the official announcement by Bitmax,** users will be able to deposit BEP2-ONE tokens in their Bitmax exchange wallets — but will only be able to withdraw native ONE tokens. The process will be fully automated, making it very straightforward. BEP2 in. native ONE out. _**Bitmax will support BEP-2 to native ONE swap only.**_
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Binance" %}
Binance will soon announce the procedure and timeline of the token swap. We will keep on posting more updates along the way. Please join our [telegram announcements](https://t.me/harmony_announcements) channel to be among the first to receive the notification. _**Binance will support BEP-2 to native ONE swap only.**_
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="HonestMining" %}
This process will be similar to Bitmax. The token holders will be able to deposit BEP2 or ERC20 ONE tokens and withdraw native ONEs. Honest Mining is also one of the staking pools supporting ONE open-staking, so if you would like to participate through their validators, you can keep your tokens deposited in the Honest Mining infrastructure.

## **What’s the purpose of Harmony’s native token?** <a id="whats-the-purpose-of-harmonys-native-token"></a>

The Harmony token is a protocol token used for a number of purposes on the network.

1. The token is used to stake in order to become a validator on the network to earn block rewards and transaction fees. We use Proof of Stake \(POS\) as our sybil resistance mechanism in the protocol.

2. The token is used to pay fees on the network, both transaction fees, gas and storage fees.

3. The token is used in voting for on-chain governance of the protocol. Without the token, the protocol could not function.
